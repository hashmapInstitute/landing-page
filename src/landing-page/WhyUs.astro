      <AccordionItem header="Focus on the fundamentals">
        <p>
          Focusing on the fundamentals helps people learn better because it
          provides a strong foundation for more advanced topics. By starting
          with the basics and understanding the core concepts and building
          blocks of a subject, learners are able to grasp new information more
          easily and apply it in practical ways. This leads to a deeper and more
          comprehensive understanding of the subject, as well as increased
          confidence and mastery in using the skills learned.
          <br /><br />
          For example, in software development, learning the fundamentals of programming
          concepts such as data types, variables, control structures, and functions
          lays the foundation for understanding more complex topics such as algorithms,
          data structures, and web development. Focusing on the fundamentals helps
          learners build a solid understanding of the subject, which they can then
          build upon as they learn more advanced topics.
          <br /><br />
          Additionally, by focusing on the fundamentals, learners are able to see
          the connections between different topics and how they fit together, leading
          to a more holistic understanding of the subject. This also makes it easier
          to recall information and apply it in new and different contexts.

      <AccordionItem header="Long term learning Techniques">
        <p>
          Long-term techniques for learning something new are often more
          effective because they promote deeper understanding and retention of
          the information. Rather than relying on rote memorization or
          short-term fixes, these techniques focus on developing a deep
          understanding of the subject matter and promoting long-term retention.
          <br /><br />
          Some of the benefits of long-term techniques for learning include:
          <br /><br />
          Improved comprehension: By focusing on understanding the concepts and how
          they fit together, learners are able to see the big picture and grasp the
          subject matter more fully.
          <br /><br />
          Increased retention: When information is learned in a meaningful way and
          connected to existing knowledge, it is more likely to be remembered in
          the long term.
          <br /><br />
          Better transfer of knowledge: Learning techniques that focus on understanding
          and retention are more likely to lead to better transfer of knowledge to
          new and different situations.
          <br /><br />
          Deeper engagement: By focusing on the fundamentals and understanding the
          underlying concepts, learners are more likely to be engaged with the material
          and motivated to continue learning.
          <br /><br />
          Long-term techniques for learning may include approaches such as spaced
          repetition, elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved
          practice.
          <br /><br />
          These techniques promote deep understanding and long-term retention by
          encouraging learners to actively engage with the material and connect it
          to their existing knowledge.

      <AccordionItem header="Focused Feedback">
        <p>
          Focused feedback is incredibly valuable when learning something new
          because it helps learners to identify areas of strength and
          improvement, and provides guidance on how to address any gaps in
          knowledge or skills. Focused feedback provides learners with specific,
          targeted information on what they are doing well and what they need to
          work on, allowing them to focus their efforts and make the most of
          their time and resources.
          <br /><br />
          Some of the benefits of focused feedback include:
          <br /><br />
          Improved performance: By receiving targeted feedback on specific areas
          of strength and improvement, learners are able to make more informed decisions
          about how to focus their efforts and improve their performance.
          <br /><br />
          Increased motivation: Focused feedback can help learners to see their progress
          and feel a sense of accomplishment, which can increase motivation and engagement.
          <br /><br />
          Better understanding: Feedback that is focused on specific areas of improvement
          can help learners to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and identify
          areas where they need to focus their efforts.
          <br /><br />
          Enhanced learning: Focused feedback can help learners to refine their skills
          and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, leading to improved
          performance and mastery.
          <br /><br />
          Focused feedback can be provided through a variety of means, including
          one-on-one instruction, peer feedback, self-assessment, or online resources.
          The key is that the feedback is specific, targeted, and provides actionable
          guidance for improvement.
